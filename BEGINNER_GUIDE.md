# 📚 BookBuddy Backend - Complete Beginner Guide

## 🤔 "I Don't Know What I'm Doing" - No Problem!

This guide is for **complete beginners**. I'll explain everything step by step!

---

## 🎯 What Are We Building?

**BookBuddy** is a hotel management system. Think of it like a website that helps hotels manage:
- ✅ Customer bookings
- ✅ Room reservations  
- ✅ Food orders
- ✅ Staff management
- ✅ Payments

**You're building the "backend"** - this is like the "engine" that makes everything work behind the scenes.

## 🛠️ Step 1: Install Required Software

### What You Need:
1. **Node.js** - This runs your website code
2. **PostgreSQL** - This stores all your data (like a digital filing cabinet)

### Installing Node.js:
1. **Go to**: https://nodejs.org/
2. **Click**: The big green "Download" button
3. **Run**: The downloaded file (it will be something like `node-v18.x.x-x64.msi`)
4. **Follow**: The installation wizard (just click "Next" on everything)
5. **Restart**: Your computer when it's done

**How to check if it worked:**
- Press `Windows + R`
- Type `cmd` and press Enter
- Type `node --version` and press Enter
- You should see something like `v18.17.0`

### Installing PostgreSQL:
1. **Go to**: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
2. **Click**: "Download the installer"
3. **Run**: The downloaded file
4. **Important**: When it asks for a password, **write it down somewhere safe!** You'll need it later.
5. **Follow**: The installation wizard (just click "Next" on everything)
6. **Restart**: Your computer when it's done

**How to check if it worked:**
- Press `Windows + R`
- Type `cmd` and press Enter
- Type `psql --version` and press Enter
- You should see something like `psql (PostgreSQL) 15.3`

## 🚀 Step 2: Set Up Your Project

### What We're Doing:
We're going to run a special script that sets up everything automatically.

### How to Do It:
1. **Open**: File Explorer
2. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\bsaru\OneDrive\Documents\db project\backend`
3. **Find**: A file called `QUICK_START.bat`
4. **Double-click**: `QUICK_START.bat`
5. **A black window will appear** with a menu
6. **Type**: `1` and press Enter (this means "First time setup")
7. **Wait**: It will do everything automatically (this might take 2-3 minutes)
8. **When it's done**: You'll see a success message

### What Happens During Setup:
- ✅ Installs all required code libraries
- ✅ Creates a database to store information
- ✅ Adds sample data (fake hotels, users, etc.)
- ✅ Sets up the configuration files

## 🎉 Step 3: Start Your Server

### What We're Doing:
Starting your website so people can use it.

### How to Do It:
1. **Double-click**: `QUICK_START.bat` again
2. **Type**: `2` and press Enter (this means "Start the server")
3. **Wait**: You'll see messages scrolling in the black window
4. **When you see**: "Server running on port 5000" - you're done!

### What This Means:
- Your website is now running
- People can visit it at: http://localhost:5000
- The black window must stay open (don't close it!)

## 🌐 Step 4: Test Your Website

### How to Test:
1. **Open**: Your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
2. **Go to**: http://localhost:5000/health
3. **You should see**: A page with information about your server
4. **If you see this**: Congratulations! Your website is working!

### What You Can Do Now:
- **Visit**: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/hotels (to see hotels)
- **Visit**: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/food (to see food items)
- **Use**: The login credentials below to test the system

---

## 🔑 Step 5: Login Credentials

Your system comes with pre-made accounts:

### Admin Account:
- **Email**: admin@bookbuddy.com
- **Password**: admin123
- **What you can do**: Everything (manage hotels, users, etc.)

### Manager Account:
- **Email**: rajesh@bookbuddy.com
- **Password**: manager123
- **What you can do**: Manage hotels and staff

### Customer Account:
- **Email**: amit@example.com
- **Password**: customer123
- **What you can do**: Book rooms and order food
