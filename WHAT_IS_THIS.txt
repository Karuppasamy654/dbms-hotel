🎯 WHAT IS A "BACKEND"?

Think of a website like a restaurant:
- The "frontend" is the dining room (what customers see)

You're building the "kitchen" - the part that:
✅ Stores customer information
✅ Handles room bookings
✅ Manages food orders
✅ Processes payments
✅ Tracks staff schedules

==========================================

🚀 WHAT WILL YOU BUILD?

A complete system that can:
- Let customers book hotel rooms
- Manage food orders and delivery
- Handle staff assignments and schedules
- Process payments (credit cards, etc.)
- Send email notifications
- Generate reports and analytics

==========================================
